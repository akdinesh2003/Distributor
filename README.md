## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: File Structure

To use the Distributor, your Excel or CSV file **must** be structured in a specific way:

1.  **Container Capacities (First Row)**: The very first row of your file must contain the maximum numeric capacity for each container. These will be your column headers in the final output file.

2.  **Numbers to Distribute (Last Column)**: The values that you want to allocate must be in the **last column** of your sheet. Each number in this column will be processed and will result in a corresponding row in the output file.

### Example File (`input.xlsx`)

Here is an example of a correctly formatted input file. The values `20, 20, 10...` in the first row are the capacities, and `100, 81, 63...` in the last column are the numbers to be distributed.

| A  | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  | G   |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 20 | 20 | 10 | 30 | 10 | 10 | 100 |
|    |    |    |    |    |    | 81  |
|    |    |    |    |    |    | 63  |
|    |    |    |    |    |    | 44  |
|    |    |    |    |    |    | 21  |
|    |    |    |    |    |    | 10  |
